The run_analysis.R code requieres that all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the course project' analysis. To run the analysis just import the file into RStudio. 
The output of the run_analysis.R is called averages_data.txt.
